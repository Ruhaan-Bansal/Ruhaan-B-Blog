CS Panel Notes.

Some stuff I learned: 

<ul>
    <li>The main thing in STEM is that you have to make sure that you have fun.</li>
    <li>Another thing was to learn how to do the process such as a the commands when coding.</li>
    <li>Mr. Mortensen would want to see what the process is when you start to code and you have finished the project.</li> 
    <li>When you go to someone to present something you have to be clear and concise and if not the other person won't understand you and get you as a serious person.</li> 
    <li>Lots of colleges will ask you "What type of person are you?" This question is mainly asked in interviews or clubs.</li> 
    <li>Just being clear and incorpoortating agile methodiology has helped some people commmunicating their ideas.</li>
    <li> You have to be clear in big companies with commits in VS code and github as it could get unorganized.</li>
    <li> 
</ul>
