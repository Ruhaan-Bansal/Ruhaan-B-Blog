CS Panel Notes.

Some stuff I learned: 

The main thing in STEM is that you have to make sure that you have fun. 
Another thing was to learn how to do the process such as a the commands when coding. 
Mr. Mortensen would want to see what the process is when you start to code and you have finished the project. 
When you go to someone to present something you have to be clear and concise and if not the other person won't understand you and get you as a serious person. 
Lots of colleges will ask you "What type of person are you?" This question is mainly asked in interviews or clubs. 
Just being clear and incorpoortating agile methodiology has helped some people commmunicating their ideas.
