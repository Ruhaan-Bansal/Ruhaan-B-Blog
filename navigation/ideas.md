## Game Idea 

This game is going to be a coding adventure for the people who will play it.

The player (computer) will start in a world in DNHS and will move to diffrent places of the campus 

## NPCS 

There will be a few NPCs in our games

#### 1. Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Brown 

Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Brown are designed to help you get started with your coding journey such as help you getting starting with your tools setup and learning how to code in VS code with your repository.
They will also help you as a teacher and will provide checkpoints (questions) when you interact with them. 

#### 2. Our helpful TA's (Rachit and Tanisha)

Our TA's who are our super seniors are supposed to help us if there is any issue. They will be providing some hints throughout the game throughout your quest for completion of the cool project that you are doing. They will be located in different places in the game. The NPC's will ask questions about clone, pull, push, rebase, and other VS and Javascript functions. 

## Quests 

Our primary quest and goal of this game is to finish our main project which is making some cool video games such as snake game, tic tac toe, and etc.

## Obstacles

There will be obstacles such as a block of Javascript. They will prevent you from going any further and you will hv to learn how to code in that particular language. Also we already learned how to code in Javascript so it should be pretty easy. 

## Ideations 

I have made a picutre on draw.io and saved in it in my blog. 

<img alt ="Ideation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5407476-0fa6-4c43-9e60-6507c74d33a6" width="350" height="600">   

This diagram has 2 major  components: 

    1.Game Environment  

    2.Game Object

        a.Characters 

            i. Player 

            ii. NPC's

        b.Background

These diagrams primarily use the update function to put the location and the current status of the object such as "stationary", "moving", and etc. 

Draw(ctx) is a function that will draw the image in the game on my blog. 

There are many other such minor functions in the game in which I don't have enough time to describe them fully but I can name a few which are really important. 

    1. interactionAction

    2. isCollison(Target)
    
OUR MOVITIVATION BEHIND THIS GAME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY IT HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING MORE CODE.
