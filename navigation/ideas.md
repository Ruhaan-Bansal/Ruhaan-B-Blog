## Game Idea 

This game is going to be a coding adventure for the people who will play it.

The player (computer) will start in a world in DNHS and will move to diffrent places of the campus 

## NPCS 

There will be a few NPCs in our games

## Quests 

Our primary quest and goal of this game is to finish our main project which is making some cool video games such as snake game, tic tac toe, and etc. 

## Obstacles 

There will be obstacles such as a block of Javascript. They will prevent you from going any further and you will hv to learn how to code in that particular language. Also we already learned how to code in Javascript so it should be pretty easy. 

## Ideations 

I have made a picutre on draw.io and saved in it in my blog.

This diagram has 2 major  components: 

    1.Game Environment  

    2.Game Object

        a.Characters 

            i. Player 

            ii. NPC's

        b.Background

These diagrams primarily use the update function to put the location and the current status of the object such as "stationary", "moving", and etc. 

Draw(ctx) is a function that will draw the image in the game on my blog. 

There are many other such minor functions in the game in which I don't have enough time to describe them fully but I can name a few which are really important. 

    1. interactionAction

    2. isCollison(Target)
    
OUR MOVITIVATION BEHIND THIS GAME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY IT HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING MORE CODE.
