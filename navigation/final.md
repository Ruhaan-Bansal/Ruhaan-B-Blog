<h1>Final Exam CSSE1</h1>
<h2>5 key things I learned over 12 weeks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub experience/Understanding of branches, pull reqs, issues, etc.</li>
    <li>Reinforces JS fundamentals I already knew, new knowledge such as For loops.</li>
    <li>Tools installation, verification, etc.</li>
    <li>Use of .md, .html, and .js and other such file types to </li>
    <li>Collaboration and communcation skills for group projects</li>
</ul>
<h2>RPG game tinkers and explanations</h2>

<h2>N@TM Feedback</h2>
The main points of feedback we recieved fell into one of three main categories (generally speaking)
<ul>
    <li>Better clarity for what to do in the game/how to make money, escape, etc. We could implement this by adding a big HTML element at the start of the game which better explains what the player's objective is.</li>
    <li>Normalize UI across the game and make the art style consistent. This would be accomplished by reworking the appearence of the StatManager, NPC Tracker, and other UIs which were not altered to fit this demo of the game (in other words, a little more polish).</li>
    <li>More minigames and increased interactivity in the gameplay. This is mainly because the game is still in early development and we plan to expand the game into multiple levels with much more content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Projects I Found Cool</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bathroom Pass</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Clever integration of Student ID into bathroom pass and effective way of keeping track of students who go</li>
        <li>Real-time tracking and time-in/time-out data</li>
        <li>One piece of feedback: making the information more accessible (moving recent entries to the top of the list) and readable (specifically in/out column).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Aesthetihawk</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves NIghthawk Pages look significantly</li>
        <li>Customization and integration into websites is smooth</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>Reflecting on my performance throughout this course, I believe I have demonstrated a strong understanding of the core concepts and skills taught. My ability to effectively use GitHub, develop interactive web pages, and collaborate with peers has been evident in the projects I have completed. While I recognize there are areas for improvement, particularly in backend development, solidifying my tools knowledge, and advanced JavaScript, I am confident in my progress and commitment to learning. Therefore, I would give myself a final grade of 0.93/1, acknowledging both my achievements and the potential for further growth.</p>
